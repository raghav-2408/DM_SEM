# Web Crawler and its Role in Searching and Indexing

**Web Crawler:**
A **web crawler**, also known as a spider or bot, is an automated script or program used by search engines to systematically browse and index content on the internet. It starts by visiting a list of known web addresses and then follows links to discover and retrieve information from web pages.

**Role in Searching:**
Web crawlers play a crucial role in the searching process by continuously exploring the vast expanse of the internet. They systematically navigate through web pages, collecting data, and updating search engine databases. When a user enters a query, the search engine can quickly retrieve relevant results from its indexed data.

**Role in Indexing:**
Indexing involves organizing and storing the information collected by web crawlers. Once a web crawler visits a page, it analyzes the content and indexes key information, such as keywords, metadata, and links. This organized index serves as the basis for search engines to provide relevant results when users conduct searches.
